# MoreSaves
A mod for hollow knight that allows "infinite" pages of saves

* Other features in the in-game menu include:
    * Change keybinds to go to the next/previous page
    * Add/remove pages
    * Back up saves
    * Restore saves
    * Add option to AutoBackup
    * Add ability to rename save
    * add the ability to edit most values in save files
