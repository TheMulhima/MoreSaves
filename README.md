# MoreSaves
A mod for hollow knight that allows "infinite" pages of saves

Use the in game controls to goto previous pane and next pane to change save pages

The default binds are \[ and \] but they can be changed in the ingame menu (which can be found in `Options > Mods > MoreSaves Settings`)

In the ingame menu, you can also find options to backup and restore saves. Do backup often to not lose any progress.
